Q) What is an IPV4 address? What are the different classes of IPV4?
A. The IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that uniquely identifies a network on a machine.
   An IPv4 address isd typically written in decimal digits, formatted as four 8-bit fields that are seperated by periods.
   IPv4 addressing system is divided into five classes of IP address. All the five classes are identified by the first octect of IP address.
   classA: Address that starts with 1-126; 8-bit network prefix)
   classB: address that starts wityh 128-191; 16 bit network prefix)
   classC: Address that starts with 192-223; 24-bit network prefix
   classD: Addres that starts with 224-239;
   classE: Address that starts with 240-255)

   Exampes: classA: used for large networks
            classB: used for medium size networks 
            classC: used for local Area networks

Q) What is a Switch?
A. 1. A network switch is a hardware device that connects multiple devices together
   2. Switches use MAC addresses to send data to the correct device.
   3. switch can improve performance and safety
   4. They can reduce collisions and increasing bandwidth
   Example: Lets say you have a network with 5 computers, A-E. If you connect these computers directly to each other, ay data that is sent from another computer to other will be broadcasted    to all computers. This can cause collisions and slow down the network. In this case switch is the best solution

Q) What is a host?
A. 1. A host in networking is a computer or other device that is connected to a network and can communicate wither other hosts on the network
   2. Hosts can be either server or client
   3. Servers provide resoirces to other hosts, such as files, printers, and application. Clients use the resources that are provided by the servers
   Example: A web server is a host that provides wep pages web pages to clients. When a client request a web page from a web server, the web server sends the web page to the client.

Q) What is Router?
A. 1. A router is a networking device that connect on or more networks together 
   2. Routers use IP addresses to send data to the correct network. Routers are used to connect different types of networks
      -LAN
      -MAN
      -WAN
   3. when a router recieves a packet of data, it looks up the destination IP addresses in the routing table, the router sends the packet to the next hop in the path to the destination          network
   4. if the Destination IP addresses is not in the routing table, router sends the packet to the default gateway. 

   Example: you are at a home and you want to go to a website. your computer sends request to you router. your router looks up the destination IP addresses in its routing table.
            The routing table shows that the destination IP addresses is on the internet.Your router sends the request to your internet service provider (ISP). Your ISP router sends the             data back to your router. your router sends the data to your computer.Your Computer displays the websites

In computer networking, a protocol refers to a set of rules and conventions that govern the communication and interaction between devices and systems in a network. Protocols define the format, timing, sequencing, and error control of messages exchanged between network entities.

Protocols provide a common language and framework for devices to communicate and understand each other's actions. They ensure that data can be transmitted reliably and efficiently across different networks and devices, regardless of their underlying technologies or manufacturers.

There are numerous protocols used in computer networking, each serving a specific purpose. Some commonly used protocols include:

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets over IP networks. It breaks data into packets, numbers them for tracking, and reassembles them at the destination.

Internet Protocol (IP): IP is a network layer protocol responsible for addressing and routing packets across interconnected networks. It defines how data is formatted, addressed, transmitted, and received.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): HTTP is an application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypertext documents (such as web pages) on the World Wide Web. It establishes a client-server communication model, where web browsers request resources from web servers.

File Transfer Protocol (FTP): FTP is a protocol that enables the transfer of files between a client and a server over a network. It provides functions for file upload, download, and directory navigation.

Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): SMTP is an application-layer protocol used for sending and receiving email. It defines the format and rules for email transmission, including message structure, addressing, and delivery.

These are just a few examples of the many protocols that exist within the vast realm of computer networking. Each protocol serves a specific purpose and operates at a particular layer of the network stack, contributing to the overall functionality and interoperability of networked systems.
Physical Layer:

Ethernet: A protocol that defines the physical and electrical characteristics of network cables, connectors, and the transmission of raw bitstreams over the physical medium.
Data Link Layer:

Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP): A protocol commonly used to establish a direct connection between two network nodes, often used for dial-up connections or VPNs.
Media Access Control (MAC): A protocol that defines how devices on a shared network access and control the physical medium, such as Ethernet.
Network Layer:

Internet Protocol (IP): The foundational protocol for the internet, responsible for addressing, routing, and fragmenting packets across networks.
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP): A protocol used for sending error messages, network diagnostics, and management functions, often associated with tools like ping and traceroute.
Transport Layer:

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): A reliable, connection-oriented protocol that provides error-checking, flow control, and sequencing of data packets.
User Datagram Protocol (UDP): A connectionless protocol that offers a low-overhead alternative to TCP, suitable for applications where real-time data transmission is critical.
Session Layer:

Real-Time Transport Protocol (RTP): A protocol used for transmitting real-time audio and video data over IP networks, commonly used in applications like video conferencing and streaming media.
Presentation Layer:

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS): Protocols that provide secure encryption and authentication of data transmitted over a network, commonly used for secure web browsing (HTTPS) and email (SMTPS, POP3S, IMAPS).
Application Layer:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP): A protocol for transmitting web pages and related content over the internet.
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP): A protocol for sending email messages between mail servers.
File Transfer Protocol (FTP): A protocol for transferring files between a client and a server.
Domain Name System (DNS): A protocol for translating domain names into IP addresses.

What is DNS in networking?

DNS stands for Domain Name System
It works like the phone book for the internet.
DNS is a heirarchial host naming system connected to the internet or any private network
The process involves converting the domain names of participating entities or hosts to a computer friendly IP addresses.
When ever you connect to the internet, the DNS server that you use automatically established by your network provider.

What is Ping?

A ping is a software utility used to verify the rechangability of a specific IP address on a network.
It works by sending internet control message protocol (ICMP) echo request to the host of a destination computer and then waiting for an echo reply.
The ping is initiated serveral times to get responses echoed back to the resource provided information such as 
"Bytes sent and recieved / Packet sent, recieved or lost".

What is Port in Networking?

A port is a communication endpoint in networking throught which information flows from a program on the computer to another computer on the network.
It is like a docking point where all the private boats are docked.
Post are numbered, and each port is associated with different service.
The allow computers to differentiate between different kinds of incoming and outgoing traffic over the same network connections.
Some ports are reserved for specific protocols:

HTTP(Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) uses port 80
FTP(File Transfer protocol) uses port 21
Email received on a local computer used TCP port 25

Each host can have 65535 ports per IP address, and then use of these ports is managed by IANA(Internet Assigned Number Authority).

What is DHCP in Networking?

DHCP stands for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol.
It is a network protocol used an IP address to automate the process of configuring devices and allow for seemless communication on the network.
A DHCP server automatically assign IP addresses to each host on the network, thus allowing them to use the services such as SNS and many other communication protocols to communicate with other endpoints.
Using DHCP, IP conflicts are reduced and it is easy to change adresses or endpoints.

What is socket in Networking?

A socket is a software structure that allows for communication between two or more programs on the same or different machines within a network node.
It can be seen as the endpoint of two-way communication commonly used in client-server application.
A socket that can be created by linking the IP number of a system with a software port number where IP number and port numbers are seperated by a

What are the HTTP & the HTTPS protocol?

HTTP is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol which defined the set of rules and standards on how the information can be transmitted on the World Wide Web.
It helps the web browsers and web servers for communication.
It is a stateless protocol where each command is independent with respect to the previous command.
HTTP is an application layer protocol built upon the TCP, it used by by default port 80.
HTTPS is the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure.
It is an advanced and secured version of HTTP.
It enables secure transactions by encrypting the communication ans also help identify network servers securely.
It uses port 443 by default.

What is the SMTP Protocol?

SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol.
SMTP set the rules for communication between servers. This set of rules help the software to transmit emails over the internt.
It supports the both end-end and store-and-forward methods.
It is always listening mode on port 25.
It always works with pop3-Post office protocol-helps clients synchronize mails.

What is the TCP protocol?

TCP or TCP/IP is the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
It is a set of rules that decides how a computer connects to the Inernet and how to transmit the data over the network.
It creates a virtual network when more than one computer is connected to the network.

The TCP features are:
1. Number Sysrem: TCP software keeps track of segment-which has two fields called the sequence number and the acknowledgement number
2. Error Control

Descrive the TCP/IP reference model and define 4 different layers of the TCP/IP reference model.

TCP/IP is a compressed version of OSI model with only 4 layers.
The name of this model is based on 2 standard protocols used i.e., TCP(Transmission Control Protocol) and IP(Internet Protocol)

Layers of TCP/IP:

Link: Decides which link such as serial lines or classic Ethernet must be used to meet the needs of the connectionless internet layer.
Internet: Holds architecture together. Delivers IP packets supposed to deliver.
Transport: Same as OSI transport layer. Enables Peer entities on the network to carry on conversation
Application: Contains all the higher level protocols.
